# EE_iot_Proj

This is an assignment project for my coursework, it is a temeprature & humidity sensoring program.
The structure is like this:

(LoRa shield + Arduino board + Sensor) -> Dragino LG01 Gateway -> Internet -> Google cloud platform

The code here is simply for setting up the webserver in google cloud (I use appengine typically).
